# Rocks game on flutter

This is scratch game. It need to stabilize architecture for Dist the Game.

In this little game I can polish methods of working with bots and UI of flutter + BLoC.

* Start generation UI + initialize state + open widget with game
  * players number
  * players type (human, greedyBot, optimalBot, randomBot, networkHuman)
    * color?
  * base counter value
* Game End (?) and restart
* Game loop with bots (Fix this: need interactive start from user (?))
* Test for game without BLoC
* Network features
