# Rocks game on flutter

This is scratch game. It need to stabilize architecture for Dist the Game.

In this little game I can polish methods of working with bots and UI of flutter + BLoC.

- [ ] Start generation UI + initialize state + open widget with game
  * players number
  * players type (human, greedyBot, optimalBot, randomBot, networkHuman)
    * color?
  * base counter value
- [ ] Game End (?) and restart
- [x] Game loop with bots
- [ ] Test for game without BLoC
- [ ] Network features
